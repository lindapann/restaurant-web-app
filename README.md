# Restaurant Web App

This restaurant web application is the final assignment in course [Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS] on Coursera.

It is a restaurant front-end implementation in AngularJS for David Chu's China Bistro.

Here are what I did for the project:

1. Create user-friendly menu categories using data on the server side

2. Build a sign-up validation form

3. Show users information after their signning up

4. Test code using Jasmine
